/// Extension for problems whose search-space bounds depend on the working dimension.
///
/// `LimitedVectorProblem::domain()` always returns bounds for the *maximum* dimension.
/// Islands that run at a smaller IRACE-tuned dimension `D` must call
/// `domain_for_dimension(D)` so initialization samples correctly bounded positions.
///
/// # Stable-Rust coherence rules
///
/// There is NO blanket `impl<P: RealValuedProblem> DimensionAwareDomain for P`.
/// A blanket impl combined with a concrete problem-specific impl would be an overlapping
/// impl pair that stable Rust rejects (E0119).
///
/// Instead:
/// * The trait supplies a **default method body** (`domain_for_dimension`) that does
///   safe slice/cycle of `self.domain()`.  Problems with position-uniform bounds get
///   this behaviour for free just by writing `impl DimensionAwareDomain for MyProblem {}`.
/// * Problems with position-dependent bounds override the
///   method body to resample their geometry at the correct density.
/// * `RandomSpreadWithDimension` and helpers require `P: RealValuedProblem + DimensionAwareDomain`
///   so the correct bounds are always available without any dynamic dispatch.
pub trait DimensionAwareDomain: RealValuedProblem {
    /// Returns search-space bounds for exactly `dim` decision variables at their correct
    /// positions for this dimension.
    ///
    /// The default implementation slices (or cycles) `self.domain()`.  This is only
    /// correct when bounds don't vary with sampling position; override for geometric problems.
