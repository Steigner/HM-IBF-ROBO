"""The HM-IBF knowledge base: the traits to look for and the anti-patterns to report.

This module is pure data. Adding a trait means appending a :class:`~model.Criterion` here;
the scanning engine in :mod:`audit` needs no change.

The traits follow the HM-IBF definition: an island model whose topology is a labelled
directed graph, whose neighbouring islands may work at different dimensions, and whose
migrants are therefore re-expressed by a transformation along a shared geometric backbone
rather than copied index-to-index.
